### Following is an example on how to `fly` a pipeline:

```
>	fly -t concourse-[ENV] login -c https://<CONCOURSE-URL> -k
>	fly -t concourse-[ENV] set-pipeline -p install-healthwatch -c ./pipelines/tiles/healthwatch/pipeline.yml -l ./pipelines/tiles/healthwatch/params.yml
>	fly -t concourse-[ENV] unpause-pipeline -p install-healthwatch
```

Once the pipeline executes successfully, there will be a new pipeline set in the concourse based on the concourse information provided in the params file of the install pipeline. Make sure your concourse instance requires authentication, failing which the `set-upgrade-pipeline` job will fail.
